    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="recipe-box">

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="recipe-box">
      <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
      <li>1 ¾ pounds ground pork</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="recipe-box">
      <li>
        Combine pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg
        and cabbage in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling in the center of each wonton
        wrapper. Moisten edges with water and fold over to form a triangle.
        Press edges firmly to seal. Keep filled dumplings covered with a damp
        towel to prevent drying out until ready to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer lined with
        parchment, making sure they're not touching to prevent them from
        sticking together; steam over simmering water until pork is cooked
        through, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
